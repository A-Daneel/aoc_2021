# Advent of Code 2021

This is my attempt to finish [2021's advent of
code](https://www.adventofcode.com) in [golang](https://go.dev/).  
Let's see if I can reach day 25.

## file structure
I might go back and refactor some code later on, but I try to keep al code that
is re-usable between days in `/utils`.  
All solutions reside in their own folder containing the file, the test, the
test data and the real data.

## testing and solution
All days have their own test files, they can be ran with `go test ./...`  
To run the code and see my solutions, run `go run main.go`
